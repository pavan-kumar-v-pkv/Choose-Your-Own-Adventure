## 🎨 **How to Format on Resume**

### **Template:**
```
[Project Name] | [Tech Stack] | [Date]
[Optional: GitHub link or live demo]

• [Action verb] [what you built] [with what technologies], [achieving what metrics/results]
• [Action verb] [technical implementation details] [with quantifiable outcomes]
• [Action verb] [specific challenges solved] [with measurable impact]
```

### **Example:**
```
